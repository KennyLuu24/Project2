## Reflection

This project gave me practical experience with building a full-stack data analysis tool using Flask and Pandas. I learned how to:
- Dynamically populate form inputs using data from a CSV file,
- Filter and aggregate data using pandas based on user-selected filters,
- Return formatted analysis results to the user interface using HTML templates.

One of the main challenges was designing the backend logic to support multiple distinct queries through a single form interface. I solved this by creating a conditional structure that handled each query option independently and rendered the result accordingly.

This project also reinforced the value of clean code and readable output formatting, as it directly impacted how effectively users could interpret the data.

Overall, the assignment helped me bridge the gap between data manipulation in pandas and deploying those insights through a web application.
